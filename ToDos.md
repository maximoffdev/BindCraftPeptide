Adjustable plddt and iptm filters during AF2 design protocol --> done


AF2 validation and filters outside MPNN loop


Amino acid distribution losses during AF2 design protocol
    - simple distriution loss
    - ProteinMPNN distribution loss


Disulfide peptide generation
    - terminal cystein sequence init
    - disulfide loss
    - pyrosetta disulfide closure and relax


Filters
    - disulfide cyclization filter
    - backbone filter
    - adjusted scores filters pLDDT, ipTM 
    - H-bonds, contact points filters
